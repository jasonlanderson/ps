## Running the app

Clone the repo and install all the dependencies with

`npm install`

Run the start script

`npm start`

Then install the expo app on your phone and scan the QR code that is displayed.
The app should appear after it builds.


This may not be applicable to everyone but I needed to install watchman on the machine for the expo system to work.

`brew install watchman`
